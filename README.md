> Use Google sheet as remote config

### ‚ú® Demo

**Sheet:**

<img src="https://github.com/theapache64/fig/assets/9678279/fb610e72-f880-4131-b9fd-0f8e255a862e" width="300"/>


**Code:**
```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
    val fig = Fig(sheetUrl = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/../edit?usp=sharing") // your Google sheet URL
    fig.load() // call this before calling any getXXX function
    println("Fruit is '${fig.getString("fruit", null)}'")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Fruit is 'apple'
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

1. üìÑ Create a Google Sheet with two columns `key` and `value`
<img src="https://github.com/theapache64/fig/assets/9678279/fb610e72-f880-4131-b9fd-0f8e255a862e" width="300"/>

2. üîó Choose "Anyone with link" and copy the link

3. ü§ù Add dependency

![latestVersion](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/theapache64/fig)

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
}

dependencies {
    // [latest version - i promise!]
    implementation("com.github.theapache64:fig:0.2.2")
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Groovy:</summary>
  
  ```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // Add jitpack
}
dependencies {
    // [latest version - i promise!]
    implementation 'com.github.theapache64:fig:0.2.2'
}
 ```
</details>



4. ‚å®Ô∏è Use `Fig.load` and `Fig.getXXX`

```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
    val fig = Fig(sheetUrl = "YOUR-GOOGLE-SHEET-URL-GOES-HERE")
    fig.load() 
    println("Fruit is '${fig.getString("fruit", null)}'")
}
```


5. üíª **Output**

```
Fruit is 'apple'
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Cache Management with TTL (Time To Live)

All `getXXX` methods support an optional `timeToLive` parameter that allows you to control cache freshness. When a TTL is specified, Fig will automatically refresh the cache from the Google Sheet when the specified duration has elapsed.

### Available Methods with TTL Support

All data retrieval methods have suspend versions with TTL support:
- `suspend fun getString(key: String, defaultValue: String? = null, timeToLive: Duration? = null)`
- `suspend fun getInt(key: String, defaultValue: Int? = null, timeToLive: Duration? = null)`
- `suspend fun getLong(key: String, defaultValue: Long? = null, timeToLive: Duration? = null)`
- `suspend fun getFloat(key: String, defaultValue: Float? = null, timeToLive: Duration? = null)`
- `suspend fun getDouble(key: String, defaultValue: Double? = null, timeToLive: Duration? = null)`
- `suspend fun getBoolean(key: String, defaultValue: Boolean? = null, timeToLive: Duration? = null)`

### Usage Example

```kotlin
import kotlin.time.Duration.Companion.minutes
import kotlin.time.Duration.Companion.seconds

suspend fun main() {
    val fig = Fig(sheetUrl = "YOUR-GOOGLE-SHEET-URL-GOES-HERE")
    fig.load()
    
    // Cache will be refreshed every 5 minutes for this specific call site
    val apiKey = fig.getString("api_key", null, timeToLive = 5.minutes)
    
    // Cache will be refreshed every 30 seconds for this specific call site
    val isFeatureEnabled = fig.getBoolean("feature_flag", false, timeToLive = 30.seconds)
    
    println("API Key: $apiKey")
    println("Feature Enabled: $isFeatureEnabled")
}
```

### How TTL Works

- **Call-site specific**: Each call site (unique location in your code) maintains its own TTL timer
- **Automatic refresh**: When the TTL expires, Fig automatically fetches fresh data from the Google Sheet
- **No manual intervention**: You don't need to manually check or refresh the cache
- **Coroutine-based**: TTL methods are suspend functions and must be called from a coroutine context

**Example:**
```kotlin
// Call site A - refreshes every 10 seconds
val value1 = fig.getString("key", null, timeToLive = 10.seconds)

// Call site B - refreshes every 1 minute (independent from call site A)
val value2 = fig.getString("key", null, timeToLive = 1.minutes)
```

Even though both calls request the same key, they maintain separate TTL timers based on their call site location in the code.

If you want to see this library in practice, you can check out this video tutorial on YouTube: https://youtu.be/E8X94pCJ2zs 

## üö´ Limitations 
- Your value field can't have two data types. To solve this always wrap your number inputs with `TO_TEXT` function. Eg: `=TO_TEXT("2.4")`
- This library uses an unofficial Google Sheets API to fetch data, which may stop working at any time. It's best to use this library only for small projects where you need quick, dynamic values without setting up something like Firebase (and honestly, most of my projects use this library as a config source and database, so if it crashes, I'll be crying right alongside you).
